# Tech 201 Python Scripting
### What is Scripting 
Scripting is writing programs to automate a task.
Coding is the process that allows programmers to create all kinds of software, apps and websites from scratch.
Scripting can be referred to as a specific type of coding that allows you to make a program do something.

Scripting is useful since it can be used to automate a single task that is repeated in the same fashion.
When scripting, you can perform highly efficient and fast editing with a limited amount of variables and data structures available.

Scripting is easier to create, can be done faster, and doesn't need a compiler.
### Is Python a Scripting Language?
Yes, Python is a scripting language.
A scripting language is one that is interpreted. Python is an interpreted language. Python uses an interpreter to translate and run its code.
Hence, Python is a scripting language.
### Why Python over other Languages?
Python is free, open-source, and easy.
Itâ€™s an interpreted language and its lines of code are scripted.
Currently, Python is one of the most in-demand programming languages in the world.
### Why is Scripting Important?
Websites, applications, and programs need scripting in order to function efficiently.
Scripting is used in program testing and also automates different processes within a program.
Otherwise, tasks such as automatic page refreshing, some video ads, and other processes would need to be done individually by a user.
Scripting creates a better experience for program users.
